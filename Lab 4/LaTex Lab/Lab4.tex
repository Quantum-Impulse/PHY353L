\section{Results}
        \subsection{Data and Analysis}

        For the data and analysis, we used the oscilloscope to visualize the behavior of the Chua's circuit. 
        We varied the initial conditions of the circuit by adjusting the potentiometers and observed the resulting behavior. 
        We also used the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across the capacitors. 
        The data collected from the oscilloscope was then exported and analyzed to identify the presence of strange attractors and fractal patterns 
        in the behavior of the Chua's circuit. There where about 5 succesful trials, and the data was analyzed using the python library matplotlib.

        \subsection{Chua's Circuit Behavior}
                \subsubsection{Initial Conditions}
                The behavior of Chua's circuit is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Small changes in the initial conditions
                can lead to large and unpredictable differences in the long-term behavior of the system. This sensitivity to initial
                conditions is a hallmark of chaotic systems and is known as the butterfly effect.

                We can see the chaotic behavior of the system in the plots of the voltage on the capacitor 1 versus the voltage on the
                capacitor 2. The plots show the presence of strange attractors and fractal patterns, which are characteristic of chaotic
                systems. The behavior of the system is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and small changes in the potentiometers
                can lead to large and unpredictable differences in the long-term behavior of the system. This was done by changing the voltage 
                feeding the circuit, and the resistance of the potentiometers.

                \subsubsection{Strange Attractors}
                As we can see in the plots, the presence of strange attractors is evident in the behavior of Chua's circuit. Strange
                attractors are characterized by their complex and irregular shapes, which exhibit self-similarity at different scales.
                The presence of strange attractors in the behavior of Chua's circuit is a key feature of chaotic systems and highlights
                the complex and unpredictable behavior of the system.
                
                These attractor points represent stable or unstable states of the system. Stable attractor points are like valleys in the
                system's behavior, where nearby states tend to converge towards the point. Unstable attractor points, on the other hand,
                are like hills, where nearby states tend to diverge away from the point.

                However, from the graphs we only see a single scroll attractor, and a double scroll attractor. This means at most the system had 
                two attractor points with the Tail 5 having a double scroll attractor. This is often called a strange attractor. From trail 1 we 
                can see the base oscillations of the system, and from the other trails we can see the chaotic behavior of the system.
                
                \begin{equation}
                        \frac{dv_1}{dt} = \frac{1}{C_1} (G(v_2 - v_1) - g(v_1)),
                        \end{equation}
                        \begin{equation}
                        \frac{dv_2}{dt} = \frac{1}{C_2} (G(v_1 - v_2) + i_L),
                        \end{equation}
                        \begin{equation}
                        \frac{di_L}{dt} = \frac{1}{L} (-v_2 - R_0i_L),
                        \end{equation}
                
                where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the voltages across the capacitors, $i_L$ is the current across the inductor, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the capacitances of the capacitors, $L$ is the inductance of the inductor, $R_0$ is the resistance of the inductor, $G$ is the conductance of the negative resistance, and $g(v_1)$ is the nonlinear function of the voltage across the capacitor 1. The nonlinear function $g(v_1)$ is given by:
                \[
                g(v_R) = 
                \begin{cases}
                G_bv_R + (G_b - G_a)E_1, & \text{if } v_R \leq -E_1, \\
                G_av_R, & \text{if } \lvert v_R \rvert < E_1, \\
                G_bv_R + (G_a - G_b)E_1, & \text{if } v_R \geq E_1.
                \end{cases}
                \]
                where $G_a$, $G_b$, and $E_1$ are constants that determine the shape of the nonlinear function. The nonlinear function $g(v_1)$ is the key element that introduces chaotic dynamics into the system, and its shape determines the behavior of the system. The presence of autonomous variables and strange attractors in the behavior of Chua's circuit leads to its chaotic dynamics. The system can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior, with attractor points representing stable or unstable states towards which the system tends to evolve.

                As we can see, our results are consistent with the theoretical projections of chaotic dynamics. 
                The behavior of the Chua's circuit is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and small changes in the potentiometers 
                can lead to large and unpredictable differences in the long-term behavior of the system. The presence of strange attractors 
                and fractal patterns in the behavior of the Chua's circuit highlights the complex and unpredictable behavior of the system. 
                Understanding chaotic dynamics and its applications is crucial in various scientific fields, and the study of Chua's circuit offers 
                valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems.


                \subsubsection{Applications in Science and Engineering}
                The study of chaotic systems, such as Chua's circuit, has important implications for various scientific and engineering fields.
                By understanding the behavior of chaotic systems, researchers can gain insights into the underlying principles of complex systems
                and develop mathematical models that capture their behavior. This knowledge can be applied to a wide range of fields, including
                physics, biology, economics, and weather forecasting.

                In physics, chaotic systems are used to study the behavior of complex physical systems, such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and
                quantum mechanics. By understanding the chaotic dynamics of these systems, researchers can gain insights into their underlying
                principles and develop mathematical models that capture their behavior.

                \subsubsection{Limitations and Errors}
                The only limitation was the presence of noise in the data, which made it difficult to identify the presence of strange attractors in some cases;
                and the limits on the analog to digital converter of the oscilloscope which caused blocky data in the graphs.

                However the uncertanties in the data were small, and the results were consistent with the theoretical projections of chaotic dynamics.




\section{Conclusion}
Overall, the experiment was successful in empirically confirming the theoretical projections of chaotic dynamics and exploring the boundaries of classical 
mechanics under high-energy conditions. The behavior of Chua's circuit was highly sensitive to initial conditions, and small changes in the potentiometers 
led to large and unpredictable differences in the long-term behavior of the system. The presence of strange attractors and fractal patterns in the behavior 
of the Chua's circuit highlighted the complex and unpredictable behavior of the system. The results were consistent with the theoretical projections 
of chaotic dynamics, and the experiment provided valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems. Understanding chaotic dynamics and its applications 
is crucial in various scientific fields, and the study of Chua's circuit offers valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems. The only limitation
was the presence of noise in the data, which made it difficult to identify the presence of strange attractors in some cases; and the limits on the analog to
digital converter of the oscilloscope which caused blocky data in the graphs. However, the uncertanties in the data were small, and the results were consistent
with the theoretical projections of chaotic dynamics.
